<h1>James P&#8756; GOLTZ (goltz20707)<br/>
  <span class="smaller">IT guy, cypherpunk, Freemason, etc.</span></h1>

<p class="p-note">I do lots of stuff.  Some of it has to do with IT and related
  security, and someone pays me for that.</p>

<p>Obviously, one of the things I don't do (or at least don't
  care about here) is web design.  I'm more interested in conveying
  information than making it look pretty.  Sorry.</p>

  <dt id="barebones">Why is this page so bare-bones?</dt>
  <dd>It's a work in progress.  I don't have much to say.  Most
    of it is hidden from unqualified observers.  I'm lazy.  Take
    your pick.</dd>

  <dt id="message">How can I get a message to you?</dt>
  <dd>Email and PGP are your best first step.  We can arrange
    encrypted IM via email; I can accommodate
    <a href="https://ricochet.im/">Ricochet IM over Tor</a>,
    <a href="https://crypto.cat/">CryptoCat</a>
    and
    <a href="https://chatsecure.org/">ChatSecure</a>,
    plus anything else you can steer me towards.</dd>
