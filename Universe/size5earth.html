Earth as a Size 5 World</h1>

<p>Let's take Earth, a size 5 world, as an example of what a world log
really looks like. Its 26 environs are in two equal
hemispheres of 13 environs each, so we can safely say that the outer
edge of each hemisphere is the equator. If each environ is the same
"height" --- the same distance in degrees of latitude from outer to 
inner ring --- then there are five environ heights from the equator on 
one side of the planet through the pole to the opposite side (two
heights per ring, plus one for the polar environ). Such a path covers
180&deg;, so each environ is 180/5 = 36&deg; in height.</p>

<p>The "width" of each environ depends on which ring it's in. The
outer ring has eight environs, so each one is 360/8 = 45&deg; wide.
The next ring in only has four environs, so each one is 90&deg wide.
The polar environ is a special case; it's a circle with diameter
36&deg;, or radius 18&deg;.</p>

<p>The end result is shown below. Notice how environs n02 and n04
cover most of North America and northern Asia, respectively, and that
only three environs (n06, s06, and s07) are completely free of any
appreciable land. When you draw land contours on a world log, this map
might be a good guide to just how big some features on the map will be.</p>
