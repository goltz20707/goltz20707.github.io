<h1><span class="sc">Universe</span>:
How Busy is a Spaceport?</h1>

<p>In the SF RPG <span class="sc">Universe</span>, 
various die rolls determine how long players must wait for a ship to a
given destination.  From section 32.4 of the <emph>GM
Guide</emph>:</p>

<div class="quote" style="margin-right: 50%">
<blockquote>
A <b>Green</b> jump route is a well-travelled commercial lane with passenger
and freight service occurring
daily (or more often). If a character or party wishes to travel this
route, roll percentile dice to determine how
many hours he must wait for a ship with available space.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
An <b>Amber</b> jump route is an infrequently travelled commercial lane
traversed by freighters and an occasional
passenger vessel. Roll two dice to determine how many days a character
must wait for available
space on this route.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
A <b>Red</b> jump route is a rarely travelled course traversed by a few
exploratory and resupply ships. Roll
percentile dice to determine how many days a character must wait for
available space on this route.
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>So we must wait 1-100 hours for a green route ship, 2-20 days for
an amber, and 1-100 days for a red.</p>

<p>
If a character must wait 1-100 hours for a ship, it follows that ships
come about once every 100 hours.  This is per destination, so we can
calculate the number of ships in a given period by noting the total
number of green, amber and red routes from a given planet.
</p>

<p>
For example, in one set of systems I generated, the planet Terraster
(in the Delta Pavonis system)
has four green, 10 amber and 15 red interstellar routes.  The math is
as follows:
</p>

<table border="1">
<colgroup span="1">
<colgroup span="3" align="right">
<tr><th>Route</th><th>Number</th><th>Hours</th><th>Per 10 days</th></tr>
<tr><td>Green</td><td>4</td><td>100</td><td>96.00</td></tr>
<tr><td>Amber</td><td>10</td><td>264</td><td>9.09</td></tr>
<tr><td>Red</td><td>15</td><td>2400</td><td>1.50</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="3">Total</td><td>106.59</td></tr>
</table>

<p>So we have a little over 100 ships taking off (and presumably also
landing) in 10 days, or about 10 ships per day.</p>

<p>But that's just interstellar ships.  Terraster also has a green
route and four red routes to other planets and moons around Delta
Pavonis.  That make it about 131 ships every 10 days, or a little more
than one ship every two hours.</p>

<p>This is based on assuming that waiting 2-20 days for an amber-route
ship means one every 11 days.  This isn't quite accurate; 11 days is
the average wait.  Nonetheless, mathematically speaking it works out
about the same.</p>
