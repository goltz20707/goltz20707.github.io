<h1><span class="sc">Universe</span>:
Spinning Earth</h1>

<p>Below is an animated GIF of the map from the <a
href="size5earth.html">previous page</a> wrapped around a sphere. The
graphic was generated as a series of graphic files (one per animation
frame) using <a href="http://www.povray.org/">POV-Ray</a>, then
quantized to 256 colors using <span class="command">ppmquantall</span>
from the <a href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/">NetPBM package</a>,
and assembled into an animated GIF with <a
href="http://www.lcdf.org/~eddietwo/gifsicle/">Gifsicle</a>.</p>

<p class="note">You may notice a
vertical line
in the Northern Hemisphere, in the Pacific, between Siberia and
Canada.
This is an artifact in the graphic; it's
 the joining line for the left and right edges of the
map. I hope to produce a version without this line 
sometime in the indefinite 
 future.</p>

<p class="note">Steve Edwards pointed out that I had the Earth
spinning the wrong way -- east to west. I don't know how I missed
that, but it's been fixed. Thanks, Steve!</p>
