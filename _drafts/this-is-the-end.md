Disclaimer: I am not a prophet.

With that safely out of the way, let me just say that there's been a
lot of things on my mind lately:

* The Highway Trust Fund runs out of money on October 29.

* The Federal debt ceiling will be reached by mid-November, even with
  extraordinary measures in place.  That's according to the
  [U.S. Treasury](http://www.treasury.gov/Documents/Treasury%20Letter%20to%20Congress%20101515.pdf)
  (PDF), the [Congressional Budget
  Office](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/50888), and the [Bipartisan
  Policy
  Center](http://bipartisanpolicy.org/library/debt-limit/). ([Stan
  Collender](http://www.forbes.com/sites/stancollender/) is calling
  this the ["fiscal
  abyss"](http://www.forbes.com/sites/stancollender/2015/10/19/get-ready-for-the-fiscal-abyss/).)

* The Federal government runs out of money on December 11.

* Style seems to be winning out over substance in the presidential
  race, and a Trump presidency --- which I feel would be disastrous ---
  is increasingly a possibility.  More generally, the US is swinging
  away from rational thought and scientific proof.
  
* [Methane
  plumes](http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2015/1017/Climate-change-Why-methane-gas-is-leaking-from-the-ocean-floor)
  that are almost certainly the result of frozen methane clathrate
  decomposing are showing up off the Pacific Northwest coast --- a
  harbinger of a rapid acceleration in climate change.  (Personally, I
  don't expect the polar ice caps to survive past 2050.)

I don't believe any of this is the result of any prophecy, or any
outside and/or supernatural forces.

I *do* believe that we're in for a very bumpy ride for the next
century or so, and I'm starting to doubt we'll come out the other end.
