There are plenty of "introduction to bitcoin" documents out there.
But I haven't posted in a while, and some people who know me might
like it if I explained it, and I didn't have anything else to do, so
here goes.

# A quick and hopefully accurate introduction to bitcoin

This is a quick introduction to bitcoin: how it works, what you need
to use it, and how to protect it.  This is *not* meant to be a
technical discussion on the inner workings of bitcoin or of blockchain
technology.  I leave that to much more detailed documents by more
knowledgeable people.

## Crash Course: Public Key Cryptography

## Bitcoin addresses, public and private

## The Blockchain

## Bitcoin Wallets

## A Typical Transaction
