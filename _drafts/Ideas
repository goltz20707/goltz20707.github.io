DQ EP

other rpgs (eg d&d) have cumulative eps, determines lrvrl, which determines how good char is at stuff.  dq uses eps as a bank -- add to it by earning eps, spend them to raise rank in individual skills.

advance rank by rank, e.g.  spend the points to go from rank 2 to rank 3, then to go from rank 3 to rank 4, etc.

three types of skills w.r.t. leveling up:

1) expend eps according to a table (weapons, skills)
2) expend eps according to experience multiple (magic, misc. skills)
3) fixed cost (characteristic points)

table gives amount to go to given rank from next-lower rank.  (put in example table, explain).  usually there's a cost to learn the skill in the first place (rank 0).

experience multiple is multiplied by rank you are going to.  for exp mult of 150, it costs 150 points to go to rank 1, 300 points to go from rank 1 to rank 2, etc.  spells are learned at rank 0; misc skills start at rank 0 (and hence don't help at first).

fixed-point costs are a fixed ep cost per point, regardless of current value.

(throw in some examples.)
