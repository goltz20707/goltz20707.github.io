title: New email address!
excerpt: In which I briefly wax rhapsodic about ProtonMail.

As of a couple of days ago, I have a new email address:
[goltz@mmert.org](mailto:goltz@mmert.org).

This email address comes courtesy of
[ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/).  ProtonMail is a Swiss-based
company providing encrypted email, which (a) puts their servers
outside of the United States and (hopefully) out of subpoena range,
and (2) is encrypted in such a way that they themselves can't decrypt
it.  Only the user's individual mailbox password can do that.

It's pretty cool, and the latest rollout has support for third-party
domains (hence "goltz@mmert.org" and not "jgoltz@protonmail.ch").
