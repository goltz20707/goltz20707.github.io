title: Melancholia
excerpt: In which I muse about a particularly blah day.

I know y'all are probably tired of my periodic brain-dumps of all my
thoughts and feelings, but today for whatever reason seems
particularly hard.  It feels like it should be a dark, gloomy, rainy
day, despite the abundance of sunshine (I assume---I can't see outside
from where I sit).  Work is slow, I can't seem to find anything to
occupy my time that interests me, I'm just sitting here like a lump,
typing on Facebook.

I feel like I can't connect with anyone anymore.  No one shares my
interests or enthusiasms, as far as I can tell, and I don't really
have anything worthwhile to add to any conversations about current
events.

It's a horrible thought, but what if I'm doing worse because everyone
in my life is doing better?  Terrie's between treatment phases, my
daughters' assorted problems are being worked out.  Maybe I feel
useless because I am, relatively, useless.  I contribute an income and
help out around the house, but that's about it.  I can't drive, and
believe me, that'll make you feel useless in this day and age faster
than anything else.

I need to go for a walk.
