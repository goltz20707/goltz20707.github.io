title: Let's Get This Party Started
excerpt: In which I begin writing a blog, for real this time.

Okay.  Despite what I wrote previously, *this* is the first real post
in this blog.  I finally have the format down to a point that isn't
quite as good as I'd like it (line lengths are too long, for one), but
that I can at least live with.

Now for the hard part: what's this blog for?

Basically I wanted a place to write that fulfilled several objectives:

1. It had to be relatively simple to create new entries.  I know I've
put in a lot of formatting work up to now, but from this point
forward, all I *should* need is to create a specially-named file on
Github.

2. It had to allow some markup.  One of the (many) things I dislike
about Facebook is that, presumably in the interest of security and
simplicity, plus not allowing people to totally screw up their
homepage (anyone remember MySpace?), they don't allow any markup.
Even simple things like emphasis, italics, boldface, etc. are
prohibited.

3. It had to allow editing from a simple text editor.

So, here we are.  The main drawbacks are:

1. No access control.  If I write it here, anyone can see it.  I can
live with that.  For now.

2. No anonymity.  Ditto.

So we'll see how this goes.
