excerpt: In which I enable HTTPS (of a sort) for the website.

Using Cloudflare's free services, I've enabled HTTPS on
goltz20707.mmert.org.  Cloudflare offers CDN and web optimization
services and DDNS protection for free for personal websites (like this
one).  It can also be configured to provide HTTPS.

HTTPS is provided via wildcard certificates, and any given Cloudflare
server apparently may be serving any number of wildcarded domains.
Because of this, it may still be possible for some other site to
"spoof" this site.

That means two things to you, the end user:

1. Traffic to and from this web site is encrypted in transit.
2. You cannot *necessarily* be any more sure than you were before that
you have reached the real, genuine web site, and that you are not
being spied upon via a man-in-the-middle attack.

A man-in-the-middle attack would require DNS spoofing or unauthorized
changes in addition to duplicating the site, so it's difficult but not
impossible.  So it's slightly more secure than it was before.

If none of that makes sense to you, don't worry.  I'm just geeking
out.
