Hello!  This is an attempt at circumventing social media.  After *yet
another change* to Facebook's GUI's behavior, I decided to see if there
was a way to abandon it and use something else.  I have already been
experimenting with [Github](https://github.com/)
[Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and I knew that had a blog feature
powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), so it was
an opportunity for me to try something new and communicate with the
world at the same time.

I don't expect to post very often, but you never know.  I hope to
eventually echo links to this blog to my
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/goltz20707),
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/jim.goltz1), and
[Google+](https://plus.google.com/+bana2s/posts) pages.  I also have
an [RSS feed](http://goltz20707.mmert.org/feed.xml).

That's all for now.  Stay tuned.
