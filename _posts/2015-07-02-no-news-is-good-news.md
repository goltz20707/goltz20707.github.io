Sorry I haven't written anything lately.  A number of factors have
contributed to my muteness:

* I was on vacation in the Shenandoah Valley June 13--22.  I know I
  promised to post from the road, but I was kind of enjoying being
  (relatively) unplugged.
* We're still down by one person at work.
* It's "federal government worker vacation" season.  Right now the
  other two people on the team are on leave, so I'm holding things
  together all by my lonesome, dealing with such emergencies as "The
  network is down!"  (i.e. "I can get to everywhere on the net except
  [funnyordie.com](http://www.funnyordie.com/).")

I'll be on leave again tomorrow and on July 18--24.  We'll see if
"post from the road" can happen then.
