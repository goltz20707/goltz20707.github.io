The [Committee for the Defence of Democracy](http://www.kod.ngo/)
([Wikipedia entry
here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_the_Defence_of_Democracy))
published a document, ["YEAR 1 under an authoritarian
regime"](https://goltz20707.keybase.pub/guide.pdf).  I've uploaded it
to my Keybase public site and linked to it
[here](https://goltz20707.keybase.pub/guide.pdf).

I *never* thought it might actually be needed here.
