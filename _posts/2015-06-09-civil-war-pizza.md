I've told this story before, but I like telling it.

Back in 1998 there was a TV sitcom, *Two Guys, a Girl, and a Pizza
Place*.  (I'll let you guess what the setting and cast were.)  As
sometimes happens, nework powers-that-be apparently decided that the
original cast of three wasn't enough, so they added another---the
Girl's boyfriend, played by [Nathan
Fillion](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0277213/).

I found that I enjoyed Fillion as an actor, so when I heard about a
new Fox sci-fi show, *Firefly*, I was intrigued.  Unfortunately Fox's
irregular scheduling and frequent pre-emption of episodes of the show
meant that I never had a chance to catch any of the 14 episodes before
the series was unceremoniously yanked off the air.

Later I caught it on DVD, and was very impressed.  I began reading
about the genesis of the show.  I found that the show's creator, [Joss
Whedon](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0923736), had come up with the idea
for the show after reading Michael Shaara's civil war novel *The
Killer Angels*, based on the Battle of Gettysburg.

As it turns out, I live within an easy drive to Gettysburg, PA, and
so, after reading all three gigantic volumes of Shelby Foote's massive
trilogy *The Civil War*, I ended up visiting Gettysburg.

I think I even ate pizza there on more than one occasion.
