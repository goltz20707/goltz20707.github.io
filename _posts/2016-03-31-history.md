Soon, for the first time in human history, [the elderly will outnumber
the
young](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/20/census-population-ageing-global).

For the first time in human history, [world urban population outnumbers
rural
population](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/population/world-urbanization-prospects-2014.html).

[Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>
levels](http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/), and (it is believed)
[global average
temperatures](https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/kids/basics/past.html),
are higher today than ever before in human history.<sup>*</sup>

Clearly we are entering uncharted territory.
