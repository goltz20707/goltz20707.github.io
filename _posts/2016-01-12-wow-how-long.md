Once again I've failed to keep this blog up-to-date.  This time it's
been nearly three months!

Hopefully --- and I know I've said this before --- I'll be posting
here more regularly.  Lately my blog-of-last-resort, Facebook, has
been really pissing me off:

1. They continue to change the user interface without notice, and (as
far as I can tell) without any overarching plan.  If I'm used to
reading people's posts in reverse chronological order, why does
Facebook insist on changing that to "top stories"?  How does Facebook
decide what is a "top story"?  Who does it show some posts from given
people to me and not others?

2. The police are <a

to use social media to ferret out criminal behavior</a>.  I probably
can't prevent that, but I can avoid making it bloody easy for them.

3. Facebook says it owns content posted to their site.  But if the
content is here and a *link* is posted to Facebook, I've got a better
claim of ownership.

In other news: the Feds didn't shut down, some family members have health issues,
and others are far away in a different part of the country.

More soon (fingers crossed).
