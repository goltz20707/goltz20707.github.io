Next week and the following week I will be on leave, again. I don't think I've ever taken  four weeks of vacation in one calendar year before. (The feds call it "leave", at least in my cabinet-level department.  Possibly because we use the same payroll processor as the military.)

I complain about my job from time to time, but I know how lucky I am.  I get three weeks of leave a year, and can save up six weeks before having to use it (actually more than that, since I don't have to get the saved total under 240 hours until the end of the calendar year).  

And yet entry-level positions in Germany get four weeks of leave.  And they're the third-largest economy in the world, so it's hard to argue that it's hurting their economy. 

Not sure what I'm saying, just thinking out loud (or in print).  Mostly just bored.
