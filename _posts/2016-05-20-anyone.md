So does anyone read these?  I strongly doubt it. 

I have four different kinds of ways to video-call someone, and no one wants to see me.  I have two phone lines and three different voice-only communications programs, and no one wants to hear from me.  I don't even know how many social medium accounts and IM programs, and no one wants to communicate.  And lots of ways to encrypt email, and no one wants to hear my secrets.

i just feel like my entire life is being lived for everyone else.  Does anyone actually even like me, or are they just hanging onto me because I help them?  How would I even know, as emotionally stunted as I am?  Probably a miracle I even have people I can pretend are friends.

oh fuck me.
