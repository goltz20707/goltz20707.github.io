I'm still trying to get the formatting right, so please bear with me.
I should also note that this blog is very much a side project, so it
often will need to take a back seat to actual paying work.

Today is worse than usual, as is often the case after a vacation or a
holiday weekend (we just had Memorial Day here in the US).

More soon, promise.
