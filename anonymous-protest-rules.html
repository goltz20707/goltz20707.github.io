<p>22 rules for public protest, as given
  in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-063clxiB8I">a video
    from Anonymous</a>.</p>

<ol class="note">
  <li value="0">Rules #1 and #2 of the internet still apply. Your
  memes are not, at this juncture, something that the real world can
  appreciate. Although meme speak between fellow Anonymous is
  acceptable, focus on the target and keep it to a minimum.</li>

  <li>Stay cool.</li>

  <li>Stay cool, especially when harassed. You are an ambassador of
  Anonymous. Although individuals trying to disrupt your demonstration
  will get on your nerves, you must not lose your temper. Doing so
  will harm the protest and tarnish the reputation of Anonymous.</li>

  <li>Comply with the orders of law enforcement officers above all
  else. Doing otherwise is harmful to the demonstration as a whole and
  may compromise your performance as a human being. Do not request
  badge numbers unless you are being treated in a very abusive manner,
  as doing so will anger officers.</li>

  <li>Notify city officials. Most jurisdictions either have rules
  about public protests, or would prefer to be notified that they are
  taking place. Know the rules for your jurisdiction and abide by
  them.</li>

  <li>Always be across the street from the object being
  protested.</li>

  <li>In the absence of a road, find another natural barrier between
  yourself and the target of protest. Doing so will make it more
  difficult for individuals hostile to your cause to come and harass
  you.</li>

  <li>Stay on public property. You may be charged for trespassing if
  you do not.</li>

  <li>No violence.</li>

  <li>No weapons. The demonstration is a peaceful event. Your
  weapons. You will not need them.</li>

  <li>No alcohol or pre-drinking. Violating this rule may easily
  precipitate a violation of rules 1 and 2.</li>

  <li>No graffiti, destruction, or vandalism.</li>

  <li>If you want to do something stupid, pick another day. These
  should be self explanatory. Violation of these rules during a
  demonstration will tarnish the reputation of Anonymous, harm the
  demonstration itself and leave you vulnerable to attention from law
  enforcement.</li>

  <li>Anonymous is legion. Never be alone. Isolation during a protest
  marks you as a target for handlers who wish to provoke an angry
  reaction from you and other hostiles. In keeping with this
  principle...</li>

  <li>Organize in squads of 10 to 15 people.</li>

  <li>One or two megaphones per squad. A megaphone is helpful for
  maintaining the overall cohesion of a demonstration and spreading
  your message. However, too many will confuse the public and render
  you hearing impaired.</li>

  <li>Know the dress code. Forming a loose yet reasonable dress code
  for protest members will help to maintain cohesion and get the
  public to take you seriously.</li>

  <li>Cover your face. This will prevent your identification from
  videos taken by hostiles, other protesters or security. Use scarves,
  hats and sunglasses. Masks are not necessary, and donning them in
  the context of a public demonstration is forbidden in some
  jurisdictions.</li>

  <li>Bring water. A dehydrated, thirsty Anonymous is not a useful
  Anonymous.</li>

  <li>Wear good shoes. Following these rules will assure your comfort
  during the demonstration. Keep in mind that demonstrations may often
  be quite lengthy.</li>

  <li>Signs, fliers, and phrases. Have yours ready. Make sure that
  signs are large enough to read. Also ensure that the text on your
  signs and your phrases are pertinent to the target of the
  protest.</li>

  <li>Prepare legible, uncomplicated and accurate flyers to hand out
  to those who wish to know more regarding the motivations behind your
  actions.</li>

  <li>Document the demonstration. Videos and pictures of the event may
  be used to corroborate your side of the story if law enforcement get
  involved. Furthermore, posting images and videos of your heroic
  actions all over the internet is bound to generate win, exhorting
  other Anonymous to follow your glorious example.</li>
