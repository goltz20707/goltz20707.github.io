    <p>I forget where these are from.</p>

    <ol class="note">
      <li>The best time for something to break is when you're
	watching.<br/>
	<em>Corollary:</em> If it ain't broke, break it.</li>
      <li>Paper doesn't crash.</li>
      <li>Always have an override.</li>
      <li>Dedication and diligence cannot be prescribed, legislated or
	regulated.</li>
      <li>Not all mishaps can be ascribed to malice or mechanical failure.
	Some people are just stupid, or insane.  (Note that "some" can
	take on values approaching "all".)</li>
      <li>In any contest between Theory and Observation, Observation
	wins.<br/>
	<em>Corollary #1:</em> Theory that contradicts observed facts is
	an indication that you've made a wrong assumption.<br/>
	<em>Corollary #2:</em> Theory that contradicts non-observational
	facts may indicate faulty observations.</li>
      <li>The Universe has its own definitions of justice and morality.
	They may not agree with yours.</li>
      <li>Loyalty is owed to people, not ideas.</li>
      <li>If you ask a question you don't understand, you will get an
	answer you don't understand.</li>
      <li>Always admit when you're wrong, and not just to yourself.</li>
      <li>It's always easier to build a levee before the river rises.</li>
      <li>Life is too short to wear uncomfortable shoes.</li>
      <li>Never be ashamed of loving your work.  You're better at what you
	love. </li>
      <li>Whatever you value most highly will be what disappoints you
	most.</li>
      <li>All crackpot or conspiracy-related theories can eventually be
	traced back to someone trying to make money.</li>
      <li>Never turn down a free ride or a free meal.  Just make sure it
	really is free.</li>
      <li>All arguments on the Internet are won by attrition.<br/>
	<em>Corollary:</em> An argument won by attrition is
	worthless.</li>
      <li>Nothing is ever as simple as it seems.<br/>
	<em>Corollary:</em> All questions are complex at a deep enough
	level.</li>
      <li>The most sacred quality in the Universe is surprise.</li>
      <li>Every idea sounds better if someone else is doing all the
	work.</li>
      <li>Any sufficiently advanced technology can be abused to do things
	it was never meant to do.</li>
      <li>It won't always get worse before it gets better, but that's the
	way to plan.</li>
      <li>People trying adamantly to warn you that "the other side" is
	engaging in an underhanded strategy are usually engaging in that
	strategy themselves.  Hence their warning. </li>
      <li>There are occasions when there is no substitute
	for "legwork".</li>
      <li><em>The Cockroach Rule:</em> If you encounter one instance
	or example of something someone would prefer remain
	hidden&mdash;corruption, malfeasance, etc.&mdash;there are a
	hundred more instances you haven't found yet.</li>
      <li>Pay close attention to whoâ€™s agreeing with you.  It will
	tell you a lot about public perception of your opinions.</li>
      <li>No profession has a monopoly on dedication and competence.<br/>
	<em>Corollary:</em> No profession is devoid of drones and
	seat-fillers.</li>
      <li>The more enlightened someone claims to be, the more likely
	they are to be batshit crazy.</li>
      <li>When you are surrounded by nails, a hammer is better than
	nothing.</li>
      <li>Every problem looks simple from ten miles away.</li>
      <li>Metadata <em>is</em> data.</li>
      <li>The longer you talk to me, the longer it will take me to
	fix your problem.</li>
      <li>When it comes to diagnosis and troubleshooting, the customer
      is always wrong.</li>
    </ol>
